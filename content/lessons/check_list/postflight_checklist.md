# UAV post-flight check list
Before packing your UAV after a flight, there are certain steps you should take to ensure safety and enhance the working life and performance of the UAV.
It's helpful to have a checklist to make sure you don't forget any important steps when powering down and storing your aircraft.

Always power off/disarm the UAV and the controler before anything else to prevent accidents. Then, we recommend following these additional steps:

## General inspection of the UAV
1. Inspect each component of the UAV for any visible damage from a potential collision or crash.
2. Check to be sure all moving parts including the propellers are secure. Carefully rotate the gimbal and see if it can rotate freely.
3. Check the battery for signs of overheating, warping or swelling. If you notice any abnormality in the battery such as decoloring, remove it immediately from the drone.
4. Check the levels and efficiency of the power of the battery.
5. Re-examine the landing gear of the UAV to ensure it has not sustained any damage during landing.
6. Clean all vision, infrared sensors and lights from any dust, sand or debris and be sure they are all functioning properly for the next flight.

## Storing the UAV and batteries
Cover the camera with its protection case to avoid scratches and damage to the gimbal.

Place the drone back into the storage bag or safety case.

When storing the batteries keep them charged at 50-75% of their capacity. This will reduce the damage and will increase their working life and performance.
