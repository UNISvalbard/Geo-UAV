To conduct an unmanned aircraft operation that isn't covered by a STS or PDRA, a Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) is required. This assessment is designed to aid you in determining the level of risk involved, proposing ways to mitigate those risks, and ensuring that all safety objectives are met. Failure to complete a SORA for such an operation could result in severe consequences.

According to the _Article 11_ of the [European Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0947) **all operations conducted in the Specific category require a risk assessment in order to obtain Operational Authorisation from the Competent Authority of the Member State where the operator is registered**.

## How does it work?
SORA offers design and operational measures to reduce harm to third parties on the ground or in the air. The level of robustness, categorized as low, medium, or high, should match the risks associated with ground and air classes. The level of robustness depends on the combination of integrity and assurance levels.
