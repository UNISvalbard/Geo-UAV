# UAV Classes

[EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/light/topics/drones) implemented a _Class identification label_ to establish the minimum features required for drones and distinguish their essential capabilities. This classification is determined by factors such as the maximum take-off mass (MTOM), technical specifications, implemented systems, and safety capabilities necessary to operate in compliance with [Regulation (EU) 2019/947](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/regulations/commission-implementing-regulation-eu-2019947).

The classification is divided into seven classes, labeled **C0 to C6**, which provide information on the permitted locations and flight conditions for UAV. The class of your UAV also determines the operating category in which it may be flown.
