# DJI flight simulator

Improve your piloting skills without risking damage to your expensive UAV. DJI offers an open flight simulator for practice. This simulator provides a realistic flying experience that accurately models the performance of each UAV model in various flight conditions, including wind and weather changes.
With this simulator, you can train in a real-world environment without facing potential risks or associated costs of real-life training.

To use the simulator, you must have a computer equipped with a 64-bit version of Windows 10 and a DJI Smart Controller that can be connected using a Micro-B to USB-A cable.

## Exercise: Start your first virtual flight

We recommend selecting the _Free Flight_ mode to get acquainted with the DJI Smart Controller and how the UAV reacts.

```{figure} assets/mode_pane.png
:name: mode_pane

There are different modes to start your practice.
```

Once the DJI Flight Simulator is running, turn on the DJI Smart Controller, and use the left joystick to select the different simulation modes. Confirm your selection by pressing the C2 button on the backside of the controller on the right, or go back from your selection by pressing the C1 button on the backside of the controller on the left.

1. Select the _Free Flight_ mode.
2. Select the UAV you want to fly with. We recommend you start with the UAV models that we will use during the course such as the DJI Mavic Series and the DJI Phantom Series.

### View modes
You can fly the UAV using different flight modes. By default, the Pilot (3rd person view) is selected. To change this, simply press the "Stop" button on your DJI Smart Controller.

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip
We recommend you practice and become confident performing take-off and landing, hoovering and movement of the UAV with:

- Livefeed or Screen view
- First Person View (FPV)
```

### Navigation tools
#### Map
On Follow and Pilot modes, click on the Focus/Shutter button to activate the map pannel on your screen. Use it to familiarize yourself with the position of the UAV and the flight path you have taken.

```{figure} assets/map.png
:name: map

The map will appear on the lower right corner of the screen.
```

#### Flight route
To activate the Flight Route mode, click on the video record button. This will display a smooth line behind the UAV, which shows the path you have been following during the flight.

```{figure} assets/route.png
:name: route
