Ready to go down the drone-flying rabbit hole?
Here are the main things that you need to do before heading out:

1. Register online as a drone operator on your National Aviation Authority Website.
See more [here](register-as-uas-operator). 
Note that this only has to be done one within the EU/EEA/CH, as it is valid throughout.

2. Insure your drone, and add your registration number and drone insurance number to it.

3. Check the Drone Geo Zones and other local regulation so that you know where you can fly your drone - always abide by the rules!
See more [here (Session 1)](uav-flight-regulations)

4. Fly Responsibly - You are the pilot and main responsible now.
Read the instruction manual and ensure you know how to operate the system prior to taking things for a spin.
Give the [flight simulator](dji-fly-simulator) a shot, too!
And always make sure to follow the [pre-]() and [post-check list]() protocols.
