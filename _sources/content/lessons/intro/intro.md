# Welcome to Geo-UAV
[Geo-UAV](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/landing-page.html) is an open-source reference work for the UAV-based data acquisition in the field.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, also known as UAVs, are being used extensively for recreational, commercial, academic, and government purposes. They are particularly useful to survey large areas accurately and efficiently. UAVs can be equipped with vision sensors with different spectral characteristics, ranging from traditional RGB cameras, through multi- and hyperspectral cameras to thermal cameras and LiDAR.

Together with structure-from-motion photogrammetry, it is possible to make virtual outcrops, which have become a common tool used by geoscientists. They have many applications, including research, teaching, outreach, and more. [Geo-UAV](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/landing-page.html) provides guidelines on how to acquire scientifically publishable data using UAVs in a safe and legal manner.

The reference work is primarily developed as a class-room aid. Best practices and tutorials are based on the experience acquired as part of the Svalbox project, which aims to digitize as many outcrops as possible in Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic).

Take a look at the Svalbox team's video showcasing their 10-day digital outcrop models acquisition campaign in Bellsund, Van Mijenfjorden, and Van Keulenfjorden. During the summer of 2021, they explored these regions west of Spitsbergen, with the aim of digitalizing renowned geological textbook examples, such as Storvola, Midterhuken, and Akseloya. The acquired footage from UAVs and 360-degree camera systems and processed digital outcrop models are openly available in [Svalbox.no](http://svalbox.no/wp-content/scripts/svalbox-map/Wordpress_Map.php) online geo-portal.
