# Flying next to airports

```{admonition} Warning!
:class: warning
Flying drones is strictly prohibited within a distance **5 km** of an airport.
```

To get an overview of airports in Norway, you can visit [Avinor's website](https://avinor.no/en/corporate/at-the-airport/droner/choose-airport). 

If you need to fly your drone within 5 km of an airport, you must obtain clearance from the **control tower**. 

In Norway, most locations are operated by Avinor, which uses the [Ninox Drone app](https://operatorportal.ninoxdrone.no/).

```{admonition} Aerodromes

## Ninox Drone App
The Ninox Drone system simplifies the process for drone operators to obtain clearance for flying near some of Norway's largest airports. It offers crucial information about regulations, airspace, and contact details to the air traffic service.

This system replaces the traditional method of requesting permission to fly drones via phone or email for several local airports.

You can download the app by following this [link](https://avinor.no/en/corporate/at-the-airport/droner/ninox-drone).
