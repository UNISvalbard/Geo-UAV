# Flying drones on Svalbard
As mentioned in the second session on [UAV pre-flight check list](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/check_list/preflight_checklist.html), whenever you design a flight plan, you have to know and comply with specific UAV operation laws in the area you are flying.

In Svalbard, the drone regulations are defined by the [Governor of Svalbard](https://www.sysselmesteren.no/en/drones-on-svalbard/) according to the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, which supersedes any information on this page.

Per 1. January 2025, these regulations state:
> Drones are prohibited in all protected areas in Svalbard, and it is not allowed to disturb wildlife.

This means that special permits are needed in all protected areas around Svalbard, including its many nature reserves and national parks.
Furthermore, special rules and regulations exist that extend to the filming and photography from the air, for which Norway's National Security Authority and the Norwegian Data Protection Authority hold a final say (and provide information).
