# Flying drones on Svalbard
As mentioned in the second session on [UAV pre-flight check list](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/check_list/preflight_checklist.html), whenever you design a flight plan, you have to know and comply with specific UAV operation laws in the area you are flying.

In Svalbard, the drone regulations are defined by the [Governor of Svalbard](https://www.sysselmesteren.no/en/drones-on-svalbard/) according to the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority.
