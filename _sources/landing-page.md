## Teaching Geoscientific drone-based data acquisition

````{margin} Part of the Geo-MOD series

This compendium forms part of the UNIS [Geo-MOD](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-MOD/landing-page.html) series:

> [Geo-UAV: Learn to fly geoscientific missions](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/landing-page.html)

> [Geo-SfM: Learn to apply structure-from-motion photogrammetry](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-SfM/landing-page.html)

````

This course is designed for students, as well as scientific and technical staff who are interested in learning or enhancing their skills in using UAV-based geoscientific data acquisition in the field.

### About Geo-UAV

```{admonition} Open access
The [Geo-UAV](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/landing-page.html) course is **open for everyone to follow online**. It is aimed as an open-source reference work for the UAV-based data acquisition in the field.
```

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, also known as UAVs, are being used extensively for recreational, commercial, academic, and government purposes. They are particularly useful in geosciences to survey large areas accurately and efficiently. This course offers guidelines on how to acquire scientifically publishable data using UAVs in a safe and legal manner.

The reference work is primarily developed as a class-room aid. Best practices and tutorials are based on the experience acquired as part of the [Svalbox project](https://svalbox.no), which aims to digitize as many outcrops as possible in Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic).

### Course content
Geo-UAV course is split in several sessions, consisting of interactive lectures walkthroughs, and exercises.
- [Flight regulations](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/regulations/regulations.html)
- [Pre- and Post- flight check list](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/check_list/preflight_checklist.html)
- [How to fly a UAV](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/howto_fly/howto_fly.html)
- [Survey plan and Data acquisition](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/data_acquisition/data_acquisition.html)
- [Questionnaire](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/survey.html)

### Learning outcomes

After taking the Geo-UAV course, the participant has demonstrated comprehensive knowledge and understanding of UAV-based data acquisition principles.
These include:

- ✔️ Planning, preparation and execution for data acquisition missions
- ✔️ UAV flight operations and safety protocols
- ✔️ Adherence to safety guidelines and regulatory requirements
- ✔️ Data acquisition techniques and flight patterns
- ✔️ UAV multirotor flying experience

### Project status
Geo-UAV is still in development, with additional tutorials and how-tos added continously to keep the work up-to-date with recent developments and evolving best practices.
